# CollegeCounselor Code of Conduct

CollegeCounselor is a community-driven initiative (originally proposed by Meraj) committed to creating a welcoming, collaborative environment for students, mentors, and contributors. All participants are expected to uphold the following values.

## Our Standards

- **Respect:** Treat everyone with kindness and professionalism. Disagreements must remain constructive.
- **Inclusion:** Encourage participation from all backgrounds, batches, and disciplines. Do not tolerate discrimination or harassment.
- **Collaboration:** Share knowledge openly, credit teammates, and support fellow contributors.
- **Integrity:** Be honest about challenges, give proper attribution, and avoid plagiarism or misrepresentation.
- **Accountability:** Follow through on commitments, communicate delays promptly, and respond to feedback in good faith.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, bullying, or personal attacks—in public or private channels.
- Discriminatory language or jokes targeting gender, caste, religion, ethnicity, orientation, or disability.
- Sharing others’ personal information without consent.
- Sabotaging project work, spreading misinformation, or abusing access to project resources.

## Enforcement

- **Reporting:** Contact the 3rd-year project admin or Coding Club leadership to report violations. Provide context, evidence, and any witnesses if possible.
- **Response:** Reports will be reviewed promptly and confidentially. Actions may include warnings, temporary restrictions, or removal from the project/community spaces.
- **Appeals:** Participants may appeal decisions to the Coding Club leadership, whose decision will be final.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub, chat groups, meetings, hackathons, and events where CollegeCounselor is represented.

By contributing to CollegeCounselor, you agree to follow these guidelines and help us maintain a safe, supportive environment for all members.
